<h1> My Early life </h1>
<p> I was born on October 29, 2002 in El Paso, Texas. I have a brother and a sister and a dog named Baloo and a cat named Manu. Before I attended Radford, I went to Faith Christian Academy, in which I attended from kinder to fifth grade. When I was twelve I finally came to Radford and it has since been great.</P>
<h2> My Fun Life </h2>
<p>I love to go on vacations and spend time with my family as well as relax and chill with my friends. I have mad so many great friends in my life and I hope in the future I can make even more. I absolutely love soccer and my favorite team is Real Madrid. I would also consider myself a geek in which I love video games, superheroes, Star Wars, and things of that sort. </P>
<h3> My Future </h3>
<p> I think that in my future, I will fo on and study medicine, like my dad. Unlike other people, I am not sure which college I will be attending. I would also consider acting an option, though unlikely. I sometimes do fear what the future will bring but I hope I can continue becoming a better person. </P>
